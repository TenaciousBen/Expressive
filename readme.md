## Purpose

Expressive is an open source, interpreted expression language in C#. It aims to evaluate formulae, with the ability to use user-defined functions and variables such that

`Evaluate("[a] + SUM([b], 2, 3)")`

will evaluate to the correct numerical, date, boolean, enumerable or text value given that the user has specified the values of `[a]`, `[b]` and `SUM`.
